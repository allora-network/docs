> Learn how your applications can consume streams of inferences from the Allora Network

You can seamlessly integrate Allora Network's inferences into your blockchain applications following these steps:

1. **Create a Topic**: start by [creating a topic on the Allora appchain](./devs/how-to-create-topic). This attracts data scientists with relevant domain expertise who are incentivized to provide high-quality and ever-improving inferences.
2. **Deploy a Consumer**: Once inferences are collected on the appchain, you can use them to your target blockchain. This is essential for powering your applications. Check if [a consumer is already deployed](./devs/existing-consumers) on your target chain and, if not, [deploy one](./devs/deploy-consumer).
3. **Verify Data**: Bring inferences to the deployed consumer for verification. You can [bring new data](./devs/walkthrough-use-topic-inference), or [use existing data](./devs/walkthrough-use-existing-topic-inference) already brought on-chain.
4. **Integrate Data into Applications**: you can now start using the verified data in your applications on the desired blockchain.
