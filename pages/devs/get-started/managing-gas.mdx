# Managing Gas with `allorad`

Invoking transactions causes network validators to do computations on your behalf and update the chain's state. These actions are compensated via _gas_. Gas is paid by wallets that send transactions to the Allora chain.

In its [v0.7.0 release](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/releases/tag/v0.7.0), Allora incorporated the [x/feemarket module](https://github.com/skip-mev/feemarket), which means that gas calculations follow an [EIP-1559-like schedule](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/eip-1559) (see: the [original EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)). This requires transactions to be structured differently from other cosmos chains.

Prior to `allora-chain` `v0.7.0` and in many other Cosmos chains, transactions are typically structured like so:

```
allorad tx emissions ... --from ACCOUNT_NAME --node RPC --chain-id allora-testnet-1 --keyring-backend test --keyring-dir ~/.allorad/ --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.2 --fees 2024700uallo ...
```

Since `v0.7.0`, transactions should instead abide by the structure:
```
allorad tx emissions ... --from ACCOUNT_NAME --node RPC --chain-id allora-testnet-1 --keyring-backend test --keyring-dir ~/.allorad/ --gas 130206 --gas-adjustment 1.2 --gas-prices 10uallo ...
```

To emphasize: This^^ is the way transactions should be structured today using `allorad`.

The specific differences are:

__`fees Xuallo` becomes `gas-prices 10uallo`__
- This is a config set in the network validators, so `10uallo` is the universally recommended value

__`gas auto` becomes `gas 130206`__
- This value can change per the use case

Other clients such as [CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and [Ignite](https://docs.ignite.com/clients/go-client) would similarly need to include these flags when building transactions.
