# Allora CLI Spec

Allora provides two CLI tools that allow network participants to perform different functions on the Allora Network:

1. `allorad` -  Used to read and write data to the chain, e.g. to create a wallet, create new topics or add/delegate stake to a reputer

  - Refer to the [Allorad Reference](/devs/reference/allorad) section for a full list of `allorad` commands with their explanations

2. `allocmd` - Handles worker nodes' seamless creation and deployment. This tool eliminates the need to write the worker node from scratch, as the CLI tool bootstraps all the necessary components to get worker nodes operational.

Let's dive into how to install each CLI tool using a few different methods.

## Installing `allorad`

### Prerequisites

You will need to install `go` to download and use `allorad` successfully.

### Installation

```Text bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/allora-chain/main/install.sh | bash -s -- v0.2.11
