# Model Forge Quickstart

The [Allora Model Forge Competition](https://forge.allora.network) is an open-source hackathon where participants attempt to create the best model for a given [topic](/devs/topic-creators/topic-life-cycle) on the Allora Network.

- Inferences are submitted to the Allora Network.
- Participants are scored based on the accuracy of their model compared to the ground truth, and rewarded accordingly.

## Getting Started

### Creating a Wallet

To get started, you'll need to create a wallet on the Allora Network.

#### Download the `allorad` CLI Tool

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `allorad` CLI tool.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/allora-chain/main/install.sh | bash -s -- v0.8.0
```

#### Create a Wallet

Run the following command to create a wallet.

```bash
allorad keys add <key-name>
```

Save your key name, wallet address, and mnemonic in a secure location. You will need this to submit inferences to the Allora Network.

### Register for the Competition

To register for the competition, go to the [Sign Up](https://vk4z45e3hne.typeform.com/to/ypA2Yl1J?utm_source=landing-page&typeform-source=forge.allora.network) page.

Fill out the form and submit your application. 

<Callout>
Input your wallet address that you created in the previous step in the `Allora Wallet Address` field.

<Callout type="warning">
Although a discord account is not required to register, participants with a discord account will be able to join exclusive channels in the Allora Discord server to get priority access to help from the Allora Labs team and other participants.

Join the Allora Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/allora).

### Successful Registration

Once you've been notified that you've been accepted into the competition:

1. Download the [Keplr Wallet Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en&pli=1) from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Connect your wallet to the [Allora Forge](forge.allora.network) site.

3. You should see an `eligible` status in the top left corner of the screen once connected.

Congratulations! You're now registered for the Allora Model Forge Competition.

## Topics

The Allora Network is categorized into distinct [topics](/devs/topic-creators/how-to-create-topic) that serve as Schelling points for model-makers to submit inferences on.

Topics are assigned an ID and categorized by a specific Target Variable, Epoch, Loss Method, and Metadata. Let's quickly explain each in the context of the Forge Competition:

- **Topic ID**: A unique identifier for the topic that participants will need to submit inferences on.
- **Target Variable**: The asset or asset pair that models are trying to predict for
  - E.g. `ETH`, `USDC/ETH`.
- **Epoch**: A discrete period during which inferences and forecasts are submitted, and rewards are distributed. 
  - Epochs are defined in blocks on the Network
  - Each epoch provides a timeframe for evaluating and scoring the performance of workers and reputers.
  - In the Forge Competition, epochs are abstracted into universal timeframes, e.g. `5min`, `1hr`, `1d`.
- **Loss Function**: Measures how far off your model's predictions are from the actual values
  - For all topics in the Forge Competition, the loss function is [`Mean Squared Error`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error).
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the topic, including the financial indicator, abstracted epoch length, and target variable.
  - E.g. ETH 5min Volatility Prediction

<Callout>
[Additional fields that define a given topic](/devs/topic-creators/how-to-create-topic) can be pulled using the following [`allorad`](/devs/get-started/model-forge#download-the-allorad-cli-tool) command:

```bash
allorad query emissions topic <topic-id> --node <node-url>
```

- `node-rpc` is the RPC URL of the Allora Network node you are querying.

Example Usage:

```bash
allorad query emissions topic 13 --node https://allora-rpc.testnet.allora.network
```
</Callout>

### Competition Topics

1. [5min ETH Price Prediction](https://forge.allora.network/competitions/1)
2. [5min USDC/ETH Volume Prediction](https://forge.allora.network/competitions/2)
3. [5min ETH Volatility Prediction](https://forge.allora.network/competitions/3)

| Topic ID | Topic | Target Variable | Epoch | Loss Function | Metadata |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 13 | ETH Price Prediction | `ETH` | `5min` | Mean Squared Error | ETH 5min Price Prediction |
| Coming Soon | USDC/ETH Volume Prediction | `USDC/ETH` | `5min` | Mean Squared Error | USDC/ETH 5min Volume Prediction |
| 15 | ETH Volatility Prediction | `ETH` | `5min` | Mean Squared Error | ETH 5min Volatility Prediction |

## Model Creation

If your registration is successful, start building your model and preparing it for inference submission to the network.

We've built out the **Allora Model Development Kit** (MDK) framework to help you get started with model creation. These models are optimized for price prediction, but can be used for other topics as well.

[**Allora MDK Repository**](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-model-maker)
- Features:
  - Large set of regression strategies to choose from
  - Easy to customize for volatility and volume predictions

We offer a comprehensive set of [documentation](/devs/workers/deploy-worker/allora-mdk) for the Allora MDK for you to dive into.

## Leaderboard

The leaderboard is a live-updating list of the top performing models in the competition. Go to the competition page for the specific topic you've entered to view the leaderboard.

1. [5min ETH Price Prediction](https://forge.allora.network/competitions/1)
2. [5min USDC/ETH Volume Prediction](https://forge.allora.network/competitions/2)
3. [5min ETH Volatility Prediction](https://forge.allora.network/competitions/3)

## Detailed Performance Metrics

We've built out an [Allora Explorer](explorer.allora.network) that displays performance metrics to help you evaluate the success of your model. These metrics are used to score your model in the competition.

Steps:

1. Connect your wallet to the Allora Explorer

![connect-wallet](/explorer-connect.png)
2. Click `Your Topics`

![your-topics](/your-topic.png)
3. Click on a topic to view your performance metrics

![topic-metrics](/topic-stats.png)
- Your `Score` and `ALLO Earned` indicate your overall performance in the topic.
