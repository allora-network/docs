# How to Query On-Chain Data of Existing Topics

To query the latest inferences and weights attributed to each worker for a specific topic:

**Active Topics:**

```
allorad query emissions active-topics [pagination] --node {RPC_URL}
```

`[pagination]` is the json key-value pair of the limit of topics outputted

**Example:** `'{"limit":10}'`

**Latest Inferences for a Topic:**

```
allorad query emissions latest-network-inference [topic_id] --node {RPC_URL}
```

`[topic_id]` is the integer value of the topic

**Example:** `1`


{/* **Latest Weights for a Topic:**

```
allorad query get-weight [topic_id] [reputer] [worker]
```
