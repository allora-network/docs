# Deploying a Consumer to an EVM Target Chain

Consumer contracts are required to bring Allora Network prices to a chain. Follow the instructions below to deploy the Consumer to a new EVM chain. 

## 1. Set up the repo

- Git clone and `cd` into the [Allora Consumer repository](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-consumer).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/allora-network/allora-consumer.git
cd allora-consumer
```

- run `yarn`
{/* 3. run `forge build` If forge is not already installed, follow [these instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install `foundryup` and `forge`. */}

## 2. Set up the deploy script

The deploy script can be found under `deploy/deploy.ts`

Replace the `ADMIN` address with the desired admin for the new consumer. 

## 3. Set up the .env file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following structure:

```Text .env
deploymentName=<chain name string>
chainId=<chain id uint>
rpcUrl=<rpc url>
privateKey=<private key hex without '0x'>
etherscanApiKey=<etherscan api key string>
```

## 4. Run the deployment

```bash
yarn
yarn deploy
```

<Callout>
You should see output indicating that the `AlloraConsumer` is being deployed, and then verified on etherscan. Deployed addresses will be saved in `/deploy/deployments/<deploymentName>.json`. If a given contract is already deployed with that deployment name, it will be skipped. Delete the deployment record `/deploy/deployments/<deploymentName>.json` to deploy new contracts.
