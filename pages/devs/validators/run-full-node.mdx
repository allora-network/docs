# Running a full node

> How to become a Validator on Allora

This guide provides instructions on how to run a full node for the Allora network. There are two primary methods for running an Allora node: using systemd with cosmosvisor for easier upgrade management (recommended) or using docker compose. It's important to choose the method that best suits your environment and needs.

***

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Go (version 1.21 or later)
- Basic command-line knowledge
- Linux/Unix environment with systemd
- curl and jq utilities

***

## Method 1: Using systemd with cosmosvisor (Recommended)

Running the Allora node with systemd and cosmosvisor provides production-grade reliability and easier binary upgrade management. This is the recommended approach for validators and production environments.

### Step 1: Install cosmosvisor

First, install cosmosvisor, which will manage binary upgrades:

```shell
go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@latest
```

Verify the installation:

```shell
cosmovisor version
```

### Step 2: Install allorad Binary

Download the latest `allorad` binary from the releases page:

1. Navigate to the [Allora Chain Releases page](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/releases/latest).
2. Download the `allorad` binary appropriate for your operating system (e.g., `allorad-linux-amd64`, `allorad-darwin-amd64`).
3. Rename and move the binary to a standard location:

```shell
# Rename the downloaded binary
mv ./allorad-linux-amd64 ./allorad  # Adjust filename as needed

# Move to system path
sudo mv ./allorad /usr/local/bin/allorad

# Make executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/allorad
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Node

Initialize your node (replace `<your-moniker>` with your desired node name):

```shell
allorad init <your-moniker> --chain-id allora-testnet-1
```

### Step 4: Download Network Configuration

Download the testnet configuration files:

```shell
# Download genesis.json
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/networks/main/allora-testnet-1/genesis.json > $HOME/.allorad/config/genesis.json

# Download config.toml
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/networks/main/allora-testnet-1/config.toml > $HOME/.allorad/config/config.toml

# Download app.toml
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/networks/main/allora-testnet-1/app.toml > $HOME/.allorad/config/app.toml
```

### Step 5: Configure Seeds and Peers

Configure seeds and persistent peers for network connectivity:

```shell
# Fetch and set seeds
SEEDS=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/networks/main/allora-testnet-1/seeds.txt)
sed -i.bak -e "s/^seeds *=.*/seeds = \"$SEEDS\"/" $HOME/.allorad/config/config.toml

# Optionally set persistent peers
PEERS=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allora-network/networks/main/allora-testnet-1/peers.txt)
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"/" $HOME/.allorad/config/config.toml
```

### Step 6: Configure cosmosvisor

Set up the cosmosvisor directory structure and environment:

```shell
# Set environment variables
export DAEMON_NAME=allorad
export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.allorad
export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true

# Create cosmosvisor directories
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades

# Copy the current binary to genesis
cp /usr/local/bin/allorad $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/
```

### Step 7: Configure State Sync (Optional but Recommended)

State sync allows your node to quickly catch up with the network. Create and run this state sync script:

```shell
cat > state_sync.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Choose your preferred RPC endpoint
SNAP_RPC="https://allora-rpc.testnet.allora.network"
CONFIG_TOML_PATH="$HOME/.allorad/config/config.toml"

echo "Using RPC Endpoint: $SNAP_RPC"
echo "Fetching latest block height..."

LATEST_HEIGHT=$(curl -s $SNAP_RPC/block | jq -r .result.block.header.height)
if [ -z "$LATEST_HEIGHT" ] || [ "$LATEST_HEIGHT" == "null" ]; then
    echo "Error: Could not fetch latest height"
    exit 1
fi

BLOCK_HEIGHT_OFFSET=2000
BLOCK_HEIGHT=$((LATEST_HEIGHT - BLOCK_HEIGHT_OFFSET))

echo "Fetching trust hash for block $BLOCK_HEIGHT..."
TRUST_HASH=$(curl -s "$SNAP_RPC/block?height=$BLOCK_HEIGHT" | jq -r .result.block_id.hash)
if [ -z "$TRUST_HASH" ] || [ "$TRUST_HASH" == "null" ]; then
    echo "Error: Could not fetch trust hash"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Updating config for state sync..."
RPC_SERVERS="$SNAP_RPC,$SNAP_RPC"

sed -i.bak -E \
    -e "s|^(enable[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*).*$|\\1true|" \
    -e "s|^(rpc_servers[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*).*$|\\1\"$RPC_SERVERS\"|" \
    -e "s|^(trust_height[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*).*$|\\1$BLOCK_HEIGHT|" \
    -e "s|^(trust_hash[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*).*$|\\1\"$TRUST_HASH\"|" \
    "$CONFIG_TOML_PATH"

echo "State sync configuration updated successfully"
EOF

chmod +x state_sync.sh
./state_sync.sh
```

### Step 8: Reset Node Data

Reset existing data while keeping the address book:

```shell
allorad tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home $HOME/.allorad --keep-addr-book
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Warning**: This command deletes blockchain data. Only run this on a fresh node or when you intend to resync from scratch.
</Callout>

### Step 9: Create systemd Service

Create a systemd service file for cosmosvisor:

```shell
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/allorad.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=Allora Node (allorad via Cosmovisor)
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$(which cosmovisor) run start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=65535
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.allorad"
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=allorad"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_POLL_INTERVAL=300ms"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

<Callout type="info">
**Security Note**: `DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES` is set to `false` for security. Validators should manually place upgrade binaries in the appropriate directories.
</Callout>

### Step 10: Start the Service

Enable and start the systemd service:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable allorad
sudo systemctl start allorad
```

### Monitoring and Management

Monitor your node logs:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u allorad -f
```

Check service status:

```shell
sudo systemctl status allorad
```

Check sync status:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
```

Once this returns `false`, your node is fully synced.

### Managing Upgrades with cosmosvisor

When a governance upgrade is approved, prepare for it by placing the new binary:

```shell
# For an upgrade named "v1.0.0", create the upgrade directory
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.0.0/bin

# Download and place the new binary (replace with actual URL)
# wget NEW_BINARY_URL -O $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.0.0/bin/allorad
# chmod +x $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.0.0/bin/allorad
```

<Callout type="info">
**Info**: cosmosvisor will automatically switch to the new binary at the upgrade height specified in the governance proposal. Monitor governance proposals and prepare upgrade binaries in advance.
</Callout>

***

## Method 2: Using `docker compose`

Running the Allora node with `docker compose` simplifies the setup and ensures consistency across different environments, but requires manual upgrade management.

### Step 1: Clone the Allora Chain Repository

If you haven't already, clone the latest release of the [allora-chain repository](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain.git
```

### Step 2: Run the Node with Docker Compose

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and start the node using `docker compose`:

```shell
cd allora-chain
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```

> run `docker compose up -d` to run the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.

<Callout type="info">
**Info**: Don't forget to pull the images first, to ensure that you're using the latest images. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure that any previous containers you launched are killed, before launching a new container that uses the same port.

You can run the following command to kill any containers running on the same port:
```bash
docker container ls
docker rm -f <container-name>
```
</Callout> 

#### Run Only a Node with Docker Compose
In this case, you will use Allora's heads.
##### Run

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up node
```
To run only a head: `docker compose up head`

<Callout type="info">
**NOTE:** You also can comment the head service in the Dockerfile.
</Callout>

### Monitoring Logs

To view the node's logs, use the following command:

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

### Executing RPC Calls

You can interact with the running node through RPC calls. For example, to check the node's status:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq .
```

This command uses `curl` to send a request to the node's RPC interface and `jq` to format the JSON response. 

Once your node has finished syncing and is caught up with the network, this command will return `false`:

```shell
curl -so- http\://localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
```

<Callout type="info">
**Info**: The time required to sync depends on the chain's size and height. 

    - For newly launched chains, syncing will take **minutes**.
    - Established chains like Ethereum can take around **a day** to sync using Nethermind or similar clients.
    - Some chains may take **several days** to sync.
    - Syncing an archival node will take significantly more time.
</Callout> 

<Callout type="warning">
**Warning**: Network participants will not be able to connect to your node until it is finished syncing and the command above returns `false`.
</Callout> 

### Syncing from Snapshot

Users can also opt to sync their nodes from our [latest snapshot script](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/scripts/restore_snapshot.sh) following the instructions below:

1. Install [`rclone`](https://rclone.org/), a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage

```bash
brew install rclone
```

2. Follow the instructions to configure `rclone` after running `rclone config` in the command line

3. Uncomment the [following lines](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/ccad6d27e55b27a7ec3b2aebd7e55f1bc26798ed/scripts/l1_node.sh#L15) from your Allora Chain repository:

```go
# uncomment this block if you want to restore from a snapshot
# SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
# "${SCRIPT_DIR}/restore_snapshot.sh"
```

4. Run the node using Docker:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
