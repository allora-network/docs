# Running a full node

> How to become a Validator on Allora

This guide provides instructions on how to run a full node for the Allora network. There are two primary methods for running an Allora node: using `docker compose` (preferred) or using a [script](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/scripts/l1_node.sh). It's important to choose the method that best suits your environment and needs. 

***

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker with `docker compose`
- Basic command-line knowledge

***

## Method 1: Using `docker compose` (Recommended)

Running the Allora node with `docker compose` simplifies the setup and ensures consistency across different environments.

### Step 1: Clone the Allora Chain Repository

If you haven't already, clone the latest release of the [allora-chain repository](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain.git
```

### Step 2: Run the Node with Docker Compose

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and start the node using `docker compose`:

```shell
cd allora-chain
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```

> run `docker compose up -d` to run the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.

<Callout type="info">
**Info**: Don't forget to pull the images first, to ensure that you're using the latest images. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure that any previous containers you launched are killed, before launching a new container that uses the same port.

You can run the following command to kill any containers running on the same port:
```bash
docker container ls
docker rm -f <container-name>
```
</Callout> 

#### Run Only a Node with Docker Compose
In this case, you will use Allora's heads.
##### Run

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up node
```
To run only a head: `docker compose up head`

<Callout type="info">
**NOTE:** You also can comment the head service in the Dockerfile.
</Callout>

### Monitoring Logs

To view the node's logs, use the following command:

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

### Executing RPC Calls

You can interact with the running node through RPC calls. For example, to check the node's status:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq .
```

This command uses `curl` to send a request to the node's RPC interface and `jq` to format the JSON response. 

Once your node has finished syncing and is caught up with the network, this command will return `false`:

```shell
curl -so- http\://localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
```

<Callout type="info">
**Info**: The time required to sync depends on the chain's size and height. 

    - For newly launched chains, syncing will take **minutes**.
    - Established chains like Ethereum can take around **a day** to sync using Nethermind or similar clients.
    - Some chains may take **several days** to sync.
    - Syncing an archival node will take significantly more time.
</Callout> 

<Callout type="warning">
**Warning**: Network participants will not be able to connect to your node until it is finished syncing and the command above returns `false`.
</Callout> 

### Syncing from Snapshot

Users can also opt to sync their nodes from our [latest snapshot script](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/scripts/restore_snapshot.sh) following the instructions below:

1. Install [`rclone`](https://rclone.org/), a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage

```bash
brew install rclone
```

2. Follow the instructions to configure `rclone` after running `rclone config` in the command line

3. Uncomment the [following lines](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/ccad6d27e55b27a7ec3b2aebd7e55f1bc26798ed/scripts/l1_node.sh#L15) from your Allora Chain repository:

```go
# uncomment this block if you want to restore from a snapshot
# SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
# "${SCRIPT_DIR}/restore_snapshot.sh"
```

4. Run the node using Docker:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

***

## Method 2: Using a Script

### Step 1: Clone the Allora Chain Repository

First, clone the [allora-chain repository](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain) from GitHub:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain.git
```

### Step 2: Install `allorad`

Before running the node, you must [install the `allorad` binary](/devs/get-started/installation/cli#installing-allorad). 

{/* You can find the [release here](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/releases) or install it following [the instructions](../learn/cli).

**Note**: Depending on your `go` setup you may need to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`. */}

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

You can refer if needed to the [CLI spec here](../learn/cli#install-allorad-binaries) and the [repo's README.md](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation).

### Step 3: Execute the Node Script

Run the `l1_node.sh` script located in the `scripts` directory. This script initializes the node and generates the necessary keys:

```shell
sh ./scripts/l1_node.sh
```

**Note**: The `l1_node.sh` script will generate keys for the node. In production environments, it is critical to use secure key storage solutions and adhere to secrets management best practices. 

### Accessing the Node

Once the node is running, its RPC interface will be available at `http://localhost:26657/`. You can interact with the running node through RPC calls. For example, to check the node's status:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:26657/status | jq .
```

Once your node has finished syncing and is caught up with the network, this command will return `false`:

```shell
curl -so- http\://localhost:26657/status | jq .result.sync_info.catching_up
```

Ensure to regularly update your node and monitor this page and the [`allora-chain` GitHub repo](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain) for any changes or updates.
