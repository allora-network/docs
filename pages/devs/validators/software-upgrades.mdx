# Software Upgrades

> How to upgrade the Allora software version during hard forks.

The Allora network relies on multiple different pieces of software to do different tasks.
For example the `allora-chain` repository handles the blockchain software that runs the chain, while
the `offchain-node` repository performs off-chain tasks. Each piece of software may need to
be upgraded separately.

## Allora-Chain Upgrades

The `allora-chain` software is a cosmos-sdk based blockchain that runs the Allora network. New 
software releases are published on the 
Allora Chain [Github](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/releases) page and are tagged
with a version number. Upgrading to non-breaking versions is as simple as downloading the
pre-built binaries or compiling the software from source and running the new version.

### Upgrading to a Breaking Version

For breaking versions such as hard forks, or software upgrades requiring changes to the underlying
state machine of the allora-chain, the upgrade process is more involved. These upgrades require 
using the `gov` and `upgrade` cosmos-sdk modules to first propose and vote on a software upgrade,
and then to execute the upgrade at a specific block height.

#### For Allora Chain Developers

For writing an upgrade the steps are roughly the following:

1. In the `app/` [folder](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/tree/main/app/upgrades), 
create a new folder for your upgrade. 
2. In that folder create a file that contains an `UpgradeName`, and a function `CreateUpgradeHandler` which 
returns a `"cosmossdk.io/x/upgrade/types".UpgradeHandler`.Optionally include a `UpgradeInfo` that is a json string telling the client software
where to download the upgrade binary version e.g.

```golang
const UpgradeInfo = `'{"binaries":{"linux/amd64":"https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/releases/download/v9.9.9/allorad_amd64.tar.gz"}}'`
```

3. Wire up the new upgrade handler to the chain by editing the `setupUpgradeHandlers` function in [app/upgrades.go](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/app/upgrades.go). You can see a reference for how to do this in the upgrade integration test [here](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/test/integration/upgrade.patch)
4. If you're upgrading standard cosmos-sdk module versions you may have to tweak the `module.VersionMap` that the `CreateUpgradeHandler` returns/processes.
5. If you're upgrading one of the Allora forked/created modules, you'll need to bump the `ConsensusVersion` for the module.
6. In the module, have the `module.Configurator` do a `cfg.RegisterMigration` with the module name, the previous consensus 
version that is being upgraded from, and the function to run to do the migration as a parameter.
7. Write a function that process the kv store or does whatever other migrations are necessary. Examples [here](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/x/emissions/migrations/v2/migrations.go) and [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/x/evm/migrations/v7/migrate.go).
8. Merge the PR, tag it appropriately and post it to the releases page.
9. Create a Software Upgrade Proposal for validators to vote on. You can see a reference where this is done in the [proposeUpgrade](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/test/integration/upgrade_test.go) function in the integration tests.
10. Convince all the validators to vote yes on the Software Upgrade Proposal, and run cosmovisor so that the upgrade will actually go through at the proposed block.

#### For Allora Chain Validator Operators

For those running the chain software, you will have to have to perform an upgrade as follows:

1. Make sure you're running the `allorad` software with [Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor) managing the process, `DAEMON_NAME=allorad` and `DAEMON_HOME=/path/to/allorad/data/folder`. Hopefully you've already run `cosmovisor init /path/to/allorad-binary` and have the `/allorad/data/folder/cosmovisor` set.
2. At some point the blockchain developers will provide you with a binary to put in that  `/allorad/data/folder/cosmovisor` folder to upgrade to. This may be optional if the `UpgradeInfo` is set correctly by the developers, but if you're the paranoid type you can always download the binary yourself ahead of the upgrade and put it in the right folder by hand.
3. When the developers put up the upgrade proposal to governance, be helpful and vote to make it pass. You can do this via the CLI with `allorad tx gov vote $proposal_id yes --from $validator` or an example of doing this programmatically can be found in the integration test [voteOnProposal](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/main/test/integration/upgrade_test.go) function.
4. At the block height of the upgrade, the old software will panic - cosmovisor will catch the panic and restart the process using the new binary for the upgrade instead. Monitor your logs appropriately to see the restart.
