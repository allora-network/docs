# Consumers
Consumers are entities that utilize the inferences generated by the network. These consumers can take various forms, from individuals or organizations making use of inference data to automated contracts that interact with the blockchain.

## Distinction between Consumers and Consumer Contracts
### Consumers
Consumers are all-encompassing actors that consume inferences on the Allora Network. These could be businesses, developers, data scientists, or any entity interested in the intelligence generated by the network.

### Consumer Contracts
Consumer contracts are blockchain-deployed contracts that consume inferences. These smart contracts automatically interact with the network to retrieve inference data and use it within their logic. For example, a decentralized finance (DeFi) application might use consumer contracts to obtain and act upon real-time price predictions for cryptocurrencies.
