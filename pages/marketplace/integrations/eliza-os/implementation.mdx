# Eliza Allora Plugin âœ¨

The Allora Network plugin for Eliza enables seamless integration with Allora's powerful AI inference platform. This integration allows Eliza agents to access real-time predictions and insights powered by Allora's sophisticated machine learning models.

## Features

- Leverage **Allora's self-improving AI inferences** within Eliza agents.
- Fetch real-time predictions for various topics like ETH price predictions, market trends, and more.
- **Simple integration** with no complex infrastructure required.

---

## Installation

First, install the plugin via npm:

```bash
npm install @eliza-sdk/plugin-allora
```

---

## Environment Variables

To use the plugin, you need an Allora API key. Add the following variable to your `.env` file:

- `ALLORA_API_KEY`: Your Allora API key. To generate an API key, visit the [Upshot Developer Portal](https://allora.network).

---

## Setup

Import and configure the Allora plugin in your Eliza agent project:

```typescript
import { allora } from '@eliza-sdk/plugin-allora'

const plugin = allora({
    apiKey: process.env.ALLORA_API_KEY,
})
```

---

## Available Actions

### Fetch Price Prediction

Get a price prediction for a specified asset and timeframe.

```typescript
const prediction = await plugin.fetchPricePrediction({
    asset: 'ETH',
    timeframe: '5min',
})
console.log(prediction)
// Example Output:
// { topic: 'ETH 5min Prediction', id: 13, value: 3393.364326646801085508 }
```

---

## Example Agent Interaction

```plaintext
User: "What is the predicted ETH price in 5 minutes?"
Agent: "I'll get the inference now..."
Agent: "Inference provided by Allora Network on topic ETH 5min Prediction (ID: 13): 3393.364326646801085508"
```

---

## Testing the Plugin

### Prerequisites

- Ensure the `ALLORA_API_KEY` environment variable is correctly set in your `.env` file.
- Install all dependencies and ensure Eliza is properly configured.

### Steps

1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   export ALLORA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Initialize the plugin in your Eliza agent.

3. Run a test interaction:
   - Ask your agent for a prediction (e.g., "What is the predicted ETH price in 5 minutes?").
   - Validate the response contains data from Allora.
