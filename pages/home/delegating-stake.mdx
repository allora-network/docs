# Delegating Stake on the Allora Network

Delegating stake on the Allora Network is a way to earn passive rewards by supporting a reputer's operations. When you delegate funds to a reputer, you enhance their stake, which improves the security of topics and increases the accuracy of loss reports. In return, you receive rewards based on the reputer's performance.

## Why Delegate Stake?

- Passive Earnings: Delegators earn a portion of the rewards generated by the reputer's success.
- Enhanced Security: Your stake contributes to the overall security and trustworthiness of the Allora Network.
- Improved Accuracy: Higher stakes allow reputers to provide more accurate loss reports.
- Withdrawal Safeguard: A withdrawal delay is in place to prevent quick attacks and ensure network stability.
