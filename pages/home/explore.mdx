{/* Allora brings together
- Consumers who pay for and acquire inferences or expertise to be revealed
- Workers who reveal inferences
- Reputers who determine how accurate workers are after a ground truth is revealed
- Validators who secure protocol state, history, and reward distributions

With these ingredients, Allora is able to improve itself over time and produce inferences that are more accurate than the most accurate participant. */}

## How to Interact with the Network

There are a few easy things a user could do to interact with the Allora Network quickly and efficiently, including installing CLI tools, creating a topic, and querying inferences off and on chain.
