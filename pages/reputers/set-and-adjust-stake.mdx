# Set and Adjust Stake 

> We define stake, motivate its use, and demonstrate how it can be adjusted

## How Stake Works for Reputers?

Stake is used to signal confidence. A reputer earns more rewards by staking on more accurate workers. To earn more rewards, a reputer should add more stake.

## How to adjust stake

The [Allora appchain CLI spec](../learn/cli) lists functions that can be used to adjust stake or help inform how one should adjust their stake

1. [Query recent inferences](../learn/cli#get-inference). One can evaluate workers' abilities by viewing recent inferences and comparing them against one's expectations or revealed ground truth. These evaluations determine how much stake one should be willing to place in oneself or another worker to get the highest return.
2. [Querying weights](../learn/cli#get-weight). One can learn about whose inferences the crowd values the most by viewing the current distribution of weights across workers. Like any actor, the revealed preferences of an incentive-compatible crowd likely indicate how one should adjust their stake.
3. [Register as a reputer](../learn/cli#register-network-actor). Reputers can begin to earn rewards for staking on accurate workers after registering.
4. [Add stake](../learn/cli#add-stake)
5. [Remove stake](../learn/cli#remove-stake)
6. [Remove all stake](../learn/cli#remove-all-stake)

To learn how to run a validator node and add stake, refer to [this tutorial](./run-full-node).

## Bridging funds to stake

One must port their funds from an external chain to set a stake in Allora. This section will be updated once the chain is up and running and bridging has been established.
