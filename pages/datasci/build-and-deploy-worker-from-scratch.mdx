# Build and Deploy a Worker Node from Scratch

> This guide helps you build your worker by yourself without the help of the allocmd CLI tool

This document creates a setup where the worker node is supported by a side node providing inferences. They communicate through an endpoint so the worker will request inferences to the side node (the Inference Server). This makes an ultra-light worker node.

To build this setup, please follow these steps:

### 0. Requisites

You should have a head node to connect the worker to.

This can be either one public head node or a head node you can run locally. We will use this connectivity data of the head to connect to it from our worker.  
To run your own head node locally, the instructions in [Allora Inference Base](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-base) can be used to set it up.

Should you want to connect to a node in the network, please [contact us](/community/contribute) for personalized access to connect to a head node.

### 1. Inference Server

Ensure you have your API gateway ready or any API server that can accept API requests to call your model. The goal of this server is to accept API requests from the `main.py`, your custom Python script executed by the node function (further details in the Node Function section below). It then responds with the corresponding inference obtained from the model. This inference is subsequently relayed by the worker node to the head node, which in turn dispatches it to the chain validators for eventual scoring.

If you have a model running but do not have the inference server, you can make a Dockerfile to bundle a simple Flask application that exposes an endpoint to access the model. Below is a sample structure of what your `app.py` and Dockerfile will look like. You can also find a working example [here](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node).

##### `app.py`

You will create a Flask application that imports the model module and calls the `get_inference`  function (this could have any name) upon API request, with the required argument. Before proceeding, ensure that all necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt ` file.

```python
from flask import Flask
from model import get_inference  # Importing the hypothetical model

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('inference/<argument>')
def inference(argument):
    inference_data = get_inference(argument)
    return inference_data

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

##### `Dockerfile`

Next, you will create a Dockerfile like below and run the `docker build -t inference-server .` and `docker run -p 8000:8000 inference-server`

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8000

ENV NAME sample

# Run gunicorn when the container launches and bind port 8000 from app.py
CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", ":8000", "app:app"]
```

You can test your local inference server by performing a `GET` request on `http://localhost:8000/inference/<argument>` (e.g. for ETH prediction model, this argument value is `ETH` ).

### 2. Node Function Python Script

To communicate to the inference, you need to have the Python script to serve as the entry point from the worker node to your inference server. You will have to write your custom logic in the `main.py` consisting of the logic to call the inference server and other processing logic to get the data ready for the head node. You can find a simple `main.py` below:

```python python
import requests
import sys
import json

def process(argument):
    url = f"http://localhost:8000/inference/{argument}"
    inference_response = requests.get(url)

    if inference_response.status_code == 200:
        inference = inference_response.json()
        # Your custom processing logic can be written here
        # Data must be provided in a `{"value":"<actual-value>"}` json format.
        response = json.dumps(inference['data']) 
    else:
        response = json.dumps({"error": "Errors providing inference"})

    print(response)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
      	topic_id = sys.argv[1]
        argument = sys.argv[2]
        process(argument)
    except Exception as e:
        response = json.dumps({"error": {str(e)}})
        print(response)

```

### 3. Identity Generation

Node identity is determined by its private key. Each node on the network is also known as a peer, which has an ID and a private key. You can generate node identity by running the following command:

```shell
docker run -it --entrypoint=bash -v ./:/data alloranetwork/allora-inference-base:latest -c "mkdir -p /data/keys && (cd /data/keys && allora-keys)"
```

### 4. Worker Node Main Dockerfile

Now that you have the node identity generated for your worker, and your node function pulling data from your Inference Server, you must bundle your worker node with Dockerfile to be tested as a whole. As stated earlier, your  Dockerfile will have to pull the `allora-inference-base` image from the [Allora Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/alloranetwork) and combine it with your custom `main.py`. Below is an example of what your `Dockerfile_node`should look like:

```dockerfile
# Pull base image
FROM alloranetwork/allora-inference-base:latest

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip3 install --requirement /app/requirements.txt

# Copy the main application file
COPY main.py /app/
    
CMD ["allora-node", "--role=worker", \
     "--peer-db=/data/peerdb", \
     "--function-db=/data/function-db", \
     "--runtime-path=/app/runtime", \
     "--runtime-cli=bls-runtime", \
     "--workspace=/data/workspace", \
     "--private-key=/data/keys/priv.bin", \
     "--log-level=debug", \
     "--port=9011", \
     "--topic=1", \
     "--boot-nodes=/ip4/{head-ip}/tcp/{head-port}/p2p/{head-id}"]


```

> Note:
>
> 1. The `head-id/head-port` value in BOOT_NODES variable are the `peer id` and `p2p-port` of the  head node and they are  `12D3KooWRX78c84ko4ZNiDFE5i2d9QT4SPxBkpT6kjzxUotQ8sNR/9010` and `12D3KooWEvNL9wXM6dzusvRpA7qo98QdsUE52x4vHtv2sttc6Za7/9011`
> 2. The `BOOT_NODE`variable can take more than one address separated by comma.  
>    It can be expressed in an ip form (`/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9010/p2p/12D3KooWRX78c84ko4ZNiDFE5i2d9QT4SPxBkpT6kjzxUotQ8sNR`) or a dns form ( `/dns4/my-dns-name.xyz/tcp/9010/p2p/12D3KooWRX78c84ko4ZNiDFE5i2d9QT4SPxBkpT6kjzxUotQ8sNR`)

With the existence of the Dockerfile in your root directory, you can now run 

```shell
# Build your Dockerfile
docker build -f Dockerfile_node -t image-name .

# run your newly built docker image
docker run -d -v ./:/data --name container-name image-name
```

At this point, your worker node is setup. If all is OK, you'll see in the logs a line saying `peer connected`. 

It now should be able to pick up published requests from the head node (for your specified topic) and return responses. 

You can test by running the following curl command to test, and see if your worker shows activity on the logs.

```shell
curl --location 'http://{head-ip}:head-rest-api-port/api/v1/functions/execute' --header 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' --header 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' --data '{
    "function_id": "bafybeigpiwl3o73zvvl6dxdqu7zqcub5mhg65jiky2xqb4rdhfmikswzqm",
    "method": "allora-inference-function.wasm",
    "parameters": null,
    "topic": "1",
    "config": {
        "env_vars": [
            {                              
                "name": "BLS_REQUEST_PATH",
                "value": "/api"
            },
            {                              
                "name": "ALLORA_ARG_PARAMS",
                "value": "ETH"
            }
        ],
        "number_of_nodes": -1,
        "timeout" : 2
    }
}' | jq
```

> It's important to note that although all Dockerfiles in this guide are designed to run independently, you have the option to run them together as services in a docker-compose file. In fact, it is advised to do so, as you can observe in the [basic-coin-prediction-node example](https://github.com/allora-network/basic-coin-prediction-node).

Please [contact us](/community/contribute) for personalized access to connect to a head node.  
You can otherwise run a head node following instructions on [Allora Inference Base README](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-inference-base).

## Deploying a Worker Node

Now that you have built and tested your worker node, Your next goal will be to deploy it to production, where it runs forever. to do that, we use the Kubernetes cluster and Upshot Universal-helm chart. While you can deploy your node however you wish, you can also follow these steps if you are not opinionated on deployment.

### 1. Build, Tag, and push your Dockerfile

The first step toward deployment is pushing your Docker image to your preferred repository. The Universal-helm chart will use the pushed image to deploy the worker node to your Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
#login to docker repository eg Docker Hub
docker login

#tag your image
docker tag image-name:tag username/repository:tag

#push image to repository
docker push username/repository:tag
```

### 2. Add Universal-helm to Helm Repository

On your Kubernetes cluster on your preferred cloud service, you will have to add the universal-helm repository to your cluster.

```shell
helm repo add upshot https://upshot-tech.github.io/helm-charts
```

### 3. Create `values.yaml` File

Provide custom values in a `values.yaml` file.

```yaml
statefulsets:
  - name: worker
    replicas: 1
    persistence:
      size: 1Gi
      storageClassName: gp2
      volumeMountPath: /data
    initContainers:
      - name: initialize-keys
        image: {image}:{tag}
        env:
          - name: APP_HOME
            value: "/data"
        workingDir: /data
        command:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - |
            KEYS_PATH="${APP_HOME}/keys"

            if [ -d "$KEYS_PATH" ]; then
              echo "Keys exist"
            else
              echo "Generating New Node Identity"
              mkdir -p ${APP_HOME}/keys
              cd $KEYS_PATH
              allora-keys
            fi
        volumeMounts:

            KEYRING_BACKEND=test 

            if allorad keys --keyring-backend $KEYRING_BACKEND show $ACCOUNT_NAME >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then
              echo "$ACCOUNT_NAME - account already imported"
            else
              allorad keys import-hex --home=${APP_HOME}/.allorad --keyring-backend $KEYRING_BACKEND $ACCOUNT_NAME <exported hex private key>
            fi
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 1001
        volumeMounts:
          - name: worker-data
            mountPath: /data

    containers:

### 4. Install Helm Chart

```shell
helm install index-provider upshot/universal-helm -f values.yaml
```

If all these are done correctly, your worker node should run successfully in your cloud cluster.
